				Predicting the trend of stock prices is one of the most important things that
				bankers, asset managers, and investors are interested in learning. Various factors
				have impacts on stock prices of an industry. As market and finance related news
				are important information that impact and even determine investors’ expectation
				of the market and future economic trends, news can be predictors of stock prices.
				Meanwhile, different news may have different levels of impact on specific
				sectors. In this project, we are interested in exploring how news in the technology
				section can impact sectoral stock prices in a four-year period. We intend to
				explore the relationship between news abstract sentiment and daily trend of stock
				prices of companies in the technology industry with natural language processing
				and machine learning methods. We used a simple moving average as our baseline
				model to do the time series prediction for the stock price. In the later process to
				improve the performance, we tried multiple models including Weighted Moving
				Average(MVA) and linear regression model, with linear regression model provides better results
				Combined with the abstract sentiment score, we found out that there are corelations between
				between the trend of news sentiment and respective section’s stock price, whearas the linkage was weak
				and could not provide much predictive power to the stock market trend.

				Yelp is an online platform that allows users to submit star ratings and narrative reviews of local businesses. As of the second quarter of 2019, Yelp has reported to
				have a monthly average of over 61 million unique users visiting the platform through desktop and over 76 million unique users visiting Yelp with mobile app and website (Yelp, 2019).
				With millions of users contributing to the local knowledge on Yelp, Yelp data has become a rich library to learn user behaviors and user sentiments for scholars and businesses.
			</p>

				Among all the data yelp provides, the user reviews is the richest in content that attracts many researchers interests. For this project, we explored the relationship between
				yelp user reviews and yelp user ratings of restaurants.
				User rating is a good indicator of user attitudes towards local business. Inspired by the novel approaches that integrate NLP with deep learning,
				this project aims to train an algorithm that predicts the classes of user ratings with user reviews.
				This algorithm could be used to detect the user attitudes to restaurants from  other crowdsourcing narratives (e.g. Tweets about restaurants) and
				can potentially expand the rating system of local restaurants.
