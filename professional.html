				Can compost be a mechanism for creating more sustainable and resilient communities?
				This is the central question guiding this project, the result of a partnership between University of Michigan
				students and FoodPLUS|Detroit. As part of a capstone course, the culmination of a Masters in Urban and Regional
				Planning program, our team set out to identify opportunities, recognize challenges, and create recommendations
				to help guide planners, policy-makers, and community members from Detroit and beyond looking to reduce waste
				and create more sustainable and resilient communities.  A capstone course is a semester-long student-led,
				instructor-guided collaborative planning experience addressing real-world problems for a real-world client.
				The aim of a capstone is to mimic a professional work experience while being conducted as a learning experience.

				Mapping Informality in Khayelitsha
			</h2>
			<p class="location">
				<strong>Location</strong>: Cape Town, South Africa
			</p>

				<strong>Team members:</strong>

				<strong>Responsibility </strong>:Spatial and data analysi, graphic design, contextual inquiry
			</p>
			<p>
				Khayelitsha is a peri-urban township situated on the outskirts of Cape Town. The most recent census was carried out in 2011 which reported a total number of 64,761‬ informal
				structures in areas designated orange in the above map. The outdated data does not illustrate the current situation in Khayelitsha. This mapping project aims to add on the
				scant of spatial analysis data by tracking the hot spots of informal structures and providing percentages of formal/informal building footprints. Maps and numbers generated
				from the process will be used to identify the trend of change in informal structures.
				With this knowledge acquired through spatial analysis, people would be able to further dig into the driving force of the increase of informal building footprint makeup.
